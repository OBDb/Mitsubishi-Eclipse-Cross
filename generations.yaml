    description: "The original Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross was introduced as a compact crossover SUV positioned between the smaller ASX/Outlander Sport and larger Outlander in Mitsubishi's lineup. Built on a modified version of the GS platform shared with the Outlander, it featured distinctive styling with a coupe-like roofline, split rear window design, and Mitsubishi's 'Dynamic Shield' front fascia. The name 'Eclipse' revived a nameplate previously used on Mitsubishi's sporty coupe, though the Eclipse Cross shared nothing with its namesake beyond the badge. Primarily powered by a new 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing approximately 152 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) featuring eight simulated gears. Some markets also received a 2.2-liter diesel option. Available in both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations using Mitsubishi's Super All-Wheel Control (S-AWC) system derived from the Lancer Evolution. The interior introduced new design elements including a touchpad controller for the infotainment system and a head-up display, though the split rear window design compromised rearward visibility and cargo space was modest for the class. Standard and available features included heated front and rear seats, adaptive cruise control, forward collision mitigation, and lane departure warning. The first iteration of the Eclipse Cross represented Mitsubishi's attempt to offer a more style-focused crossover alongside its more practical offerings, though the unconventional rear styling proved controversial with consumers and critics."

    description: "The substantially refreshed Eclipse Cross received significant exterior styling changes, most notably abandoning the controversial split rear window design in favor of a more conventional tailgate with redesigned taillights, improving both aesthetics and rearward visibility. The front fascia was also updated with revised lighting elements and bumper design, while the overall dimensions increased slightly, adding about 5.5 inches to the overall length. The interior received more subtle updates focused on usability, with an updated infotainment system featuring a larger 8-inch touchscreen positioned closer to the driver and redesigned with improved functionality, eliminating the previous touchpad controller. The powertrain remained largely unchanged with the 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder continuing as the primary offering, though refinements improved overall drivability. A significant addition was the plug-in hybrid (PHEV) powertrain in select markets, adapting the system from the Outlander PHEV with a 2.4-liter gasoline engine combined with electric motors at both axles, providing all-wheel drive capability and approximately 22 miles of electric-only range. The chassis received minor refinements to improve ride quality and handling precision, while additional sound insulation enhanced overall refinement. Safety technology expanded to include improved driver assistance features and additional airbags. The updated Eclipse Cross addressed many of the criticisms of the original model while maintaining its position as a style-focused alternative in Mitsubishi's crossover lineup, bridging the gap between mainstream compact crossovers and more premium offerings."
